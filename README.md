# About Fair Districts GA
___
Fair Districts GA is a non-partisan, non-profit organization that works to encourage a fair and transparent redistricting process in Georgia.  Our focus is to fight gerrymandering; the practice of drawing legislative district lines to favor one group over another. Our ultimate goal is to reform Georgia’s process for drawing state and federal electoral maps.

Thanks to an innovative partnership with the _Princeton Gerrymandering Project_, we now have the same  “big data” formerly only available to state redistricting committees, which allows us to equip legislators and citizens with the non-biased, statistical data needed to understand existing maps and evaluate new ones as they’re developed.

Our three areas of focus are “Listen” (hold pubic hearings and meaningfully engage with understanding communities of interest), “Show Your Work” (make your data and methodology public) and “Check Your Work” (using the non-partisan, statistical benchmarks developed by the Princeton Gerrymandering Project to evaluate proposed maps for racial or partisan bias).

Georgia’s current redistricting system gives lawmakers broad leeway to draw district maps for Congressional, state senate, and state house seats.  Fair Districts GA supports stronger standards and a nonpartisan, transparent, accountable redistricting process.

We collaborate with advocacy groups and grassroots organizations to inform Georgians about gerrymandering, advocate for redistricting reform legislation, and engage concerned citizens in our cause.
